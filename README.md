# breakout

A basic breakout game from a [Mozilla tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript). The goal was to convert the Mozilla tutorial to use modern Javascript. I began with converting **var** with **const** and **let** to scope the variables to where they're needed and prevent accidental reassignements that you may see with var as the project scales. Afterwords, I transitioned functions to be more object oriented to allow for reusability. 

Play the game [here](https://alexbarksdale.github.io/breakout/)!
